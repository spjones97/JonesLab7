## Assignment Instructions
Download and open the directory entitled CSS-grid-images, below. Your task is to create a layout like the one depicted in those images, using CSS grid properties only for layout purposes. Here's what you need to know:

1. Your main project directory should be called YourlastnameLab7. It should contain index.html (properly formatted and valid, of course) and a (linked, of course) styles.css.
2. You may use box model properties (padding, margins, borders, etc.) and other styling properties, but you may not use positioning properties or floats. You must use CSS grid to create the layout. You may use a nested grid or flexbox properties to handle the left-hand navbar items, though flexbox might be better suited to create the navigation elements.
3. You may use your own colors, fonts, sizes, text, etc., but the number of elements and their behavior upon resizing should look like these images.
4. The columns can contain any content you wish. Or none at all.
5. All elements and areas should replicate the proportions (sizing, spacing) pictured, to a reasonable extent. Don't worry about the specific numbers, just make sure the layouts are recognizably similar.
6. You will need to use at least one media query in this assignment. 
7. The navigation menu items should change color on hover at all screen sizes.

When you're finished, zip/compress the folder and attach it here by the deadline.
